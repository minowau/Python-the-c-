## Technical Debt

### Code Quality
- Need better documentation for compiler components
- Require more comprehensive test coverage
- Code organization in compiler directory needs improvement

### Performance
- Memory manager needs optimization for large allocations
- JIT compiler needs better handling of complex data structures
- Type system needs optimization for template-heavy code

## Next Steps

2. Enhance tensor operations support
3. Implement C++ interoperability layer
4. Add GPU acceleration support
5. Improve memory management system
6. Expand test coverage
